        <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

            <p>Pesto pasta has always been a comfort dish for me; itâ€™s quick, itâ€™s easy, and great food for a dinner party or a comfy night in! It requires six main ingredients, plus additional spices as you see fit. If youâ€™re not in the mood for pasta, you can always eat the pesto sauce on bread, crackers, or eggs! This recipe makes enough for around 4 people, so adjust accordingly. </p>
            <h2>Recipe Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>2 cups fresh basil leaves, packed (can add some spinach if you don't have enough basil leaves)</li>
            <li>Â¾ cup freshly grated Parmesan or Romano cheese</li>
            <li>Â½ cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>â…“ cup pine nuts (can sub with same amount of chopped walnuts)</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
            <li>8 oz of your choice of pasta (my preferred is penne, but any type will work)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat up water in a pot for the pasta and put in a teaspoon of salt. </li>
                <li>Pulse the basil and pine nuts in a food processor. Add a bit of olive oil as need be if the ingredients are too dry. </li>
                <li>Add the garlic and cheese to the food processor. </li>
                <li>Once water starts boiling in the pot, add pasta. Stir every couple of minutes. </li>
                <li>While the food processor is running, slowly pour in olive oil. </li>
                <li>Once pasta is al-dente, turn off the heat and drain the pasta water. Save some of it if you want your pesto to be slightly thinner. </li>
                <li>Add the pasta back into the pot, mix in the pesto, and voila! </li>
            </ol>
